<h2 style="color:purple"> Hello welcome to my page my name is Favour Agabi and I'm 15 years old. I have 3 siblings with me being the third child. I was born in Abuja, Nigeria, but recently moved here . I'm still in high school, and it brings me joy to see people actually try to look good for school. I love fashion which drove to incoporate that aspect in coding. I am recently partaking in a Girls who Code program, which is a program that decelops you in you computer science skill. </h2>
